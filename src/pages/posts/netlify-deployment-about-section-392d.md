Great news! At least for myself üòâ.

In my previous post, my goal for this next update is to get the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) deployment working. That is done, together with the About Section as shown in the cover image above.

The about section now briefly introduce myself (of course it did ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), has a link to my resume PDF, and the motivations behind creating the portfolio site.

This update is the first update that I didn't push any changes to Github. All update done in this post is via the [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/), including my profile picture. There's still much more other features to explore in Contentful, including an auto deploy in Netlify if there's any content published. I believe that is achievable via webhook. Though, that's a lower priority item as of now. 

Next up, adding my existing projects in the project section! One of them is my old static site which is now live at https://wizlee.dev. 

Adding a liquid tag of my previous post because it looks cool üòé

<iframe class="liquidTag" src="https://dev.to/embed/link?args=https%3A%2F%2Fdev.to%2Fwizlee%2Fcreating-portfolio-site-2-5ang" style="border: 0; width: 100%;"></iframe>
