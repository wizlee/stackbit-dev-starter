### Confession üó£ <a name="Confession"></a>
This is a confession - I deviated from my goal of automatically redeploy my site whenever I posted a new DEV article. I became a wandererüë®‚ÄçüöÄ. I wander into admiring with how clean https://www.emgoto.com/ looks, and the elegant background of https://coffeecodeclimb.com...

OK, wanderer is an exaggeration because everything mentioned below is the result of attempting to achieve the goal. Nonetheless, I did feel that I moves at a üêå speed as compared to the progress made in my previous posts in the series. 

With the mini venting out of the way, I did learnt about Frontmatter and Stackbit during the process of figuring out how to redeploy my static site whenever a new article is posted. These two are the sharing of this article.

### Frontmatter <a name="Frontmatter"></a>
Shall keep this section short as found that [this article by coffeecodeclimb](https://coffeecodeclimb.com/what-is-frontmatter/) explained it nicely. 

In a single sentence - Frontmatter is the first and topmost section of a markdown document enclosed in two triple dash 
`---`
 lines, with YAML syntax content. Example as below:

```YAML
---
title: Frontmatter as short as possible
tags: [code, frontmatter, blog, yaml]
---
```


### Stackbit <a name="Stackbit"></a>

I first came across [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) when reading beeman's dev article on automating your dev posts using github-actions.

<iframe class="liquidTag" src="https://dev.to/embed/link?args=beeman%2Fautomate-your-dev-posts-using-github-actions-4hp3" style="border: 0; width: 100%;"></iframe>


The majority of the articles online intend to ultimately use git as the content management system, including beeman's article above. However I am not yet ready for that step and I intend to still store my articles exclusively in DEV. 

This is where the mentioned of Stackbit in the article becomes of interest. Quoted:
> The build on Netlify happens in one of two occasions: 
> when my content on DEV updates or when the GitHub repo updates.

That is exactly what I aimed for and best still there's no need for an extra Github action, or [Travis CI](https://dev.to/maxime1992/manage-your-dev-to-blog-posts-from-a-git-repo-and-use-continuous-deployment-to-auto-publish-update-them-143j) and [Pipedream](https://dev.to/dylburger/publish-dev-articles-from-a-git-repo-with-github-pipedream-505j) as explained in other excellent articles.

At first I tried the "Import Site" feature of Stackbit in hope that it will work out of the box, unfortunately it failed and I yet to wrap my head around on the failure. 

Then, I attempted to create a fresh site from the Stackbit dashboard in order to understand more about how the DEV integration works. I only able to figure out how to do that after reading this DEV guide - https://dev.to/connecting-with-stackbit. 
- Use this DEV Stackbit flow - https://app.stackbit.com/create?ref=devto, only then DEV will show up as the choice in CMS.
- Or you can go to [dev extension settings](https://dev.to/settings/extensions) and enable Stackbit integration as showed below

The rest of the steps are very intuitive, the site will be live after following the on-screen instructions by connecting to services such as Netlify & Github. Example site using the 'Fresh' theme - https://stackbit-dev-starter.netlify.app/. 

Next up, figure out how the Stackbit Dev Integration works and implement it into https://wizlee.dev!
