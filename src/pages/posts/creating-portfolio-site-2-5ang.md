The cover image above shows the [gatsby-starter-mate](https://gatsby-starter-mate.netlify.app/) working locally on my PC. The landing page customization is done by setting up my own [Contentful CMS account](https://app.contentful.com).

Learn about [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org/) (a react primitive UI components built with [Styled System](https://styled-system.com)) when trying to make the [React TextLoop component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-text-loop) to work properly. I was not able to make the text inside of the TextLoop component to wrap around to the next line. The solution is to set the 
`noWrap`
 props of the component to 
`false`
. 

Another great learning when working using Rebass is [responsive styles](https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles), specifically on how [array props](https://styled-system.com/guides/array-props) works. The syntax of using array 
`[]`
 to represent media query breakpoints needs some getting used to, but once I did it looks so clean and sweet üç¨! 

Next post - deploying using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
